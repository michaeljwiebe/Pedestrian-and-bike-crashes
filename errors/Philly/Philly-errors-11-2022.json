A driver in a \"silver/blue\" 2005 Ford Mustang struck a 51-year-old man on a scooter, shattering his leg. The driver struck three other cars in the valet area before fleeing the scene. The driver then knocked a 53-year-old man off of a bicycle at Broad and Spring Garden streets. He was taken to an area hospital in stable condition.
